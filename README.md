Traffic Accident Data Analysis

# 🚦 Task 5 – Traffic Accident Data Analysis  

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. The objective is to discover accident hotspots and understand contributing factors using data visualization techniques.

The analysis helps uncover insights that can support road safety improvements and informed decision-making.

## 📊 Project Workflow

### 1️⃣ Data Loading & Cleaning
- Handled missing values
- Converted date-time columns
- Removed duplicates
- Standardized categorical variables

### 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Accidents by hour of the day
- Accidents by day of the week
- Accidents by weather condition
- Accidents by road condition
- Severity distribution

### 3️⃣ Visualization & Pattern Identification
- Bar charts for weather and road conditions
